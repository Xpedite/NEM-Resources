# Introduction

This repository is an attempt to list all available resources for the [NEM](nem.io) blockchain platform (*Probably the best blockchain in the world.*)

Lots of NEM related information and repositories exist but we might be overdoing the *decentralization* part a little ;-)

The intention of this repository is to engage community members in sharing their/others repositories or other interesting information and centralize this over here.

I encourage everyone to cooperate on this and make pull requests or issues as required; but before you do, please consider the following:
- For issues:
  - Prevent creating duplicate issues

- For pull requests:
  - Ensure the pull request has a useful title
  - Pull requests that change the structure of the docs will be closed. If you want to change the structure, please open an issue

- When you don't want to use GitHub:
  - *We'll see how this works out, I might remove this option if it proves to difficult to mangage.*
  - Ping me on one of the channels listed below in Contact
  - Give me an exact description of what could be changed
